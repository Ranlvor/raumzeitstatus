=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick summary of what the module does.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

=cut

sub run {
    my ($self) = @_;
    $Instance = $self;

    my $db = raumstatusd::BenutzerDB->new;

    my $unifi = raumstatusd::Unifi->new->run;

    while (my $event = $self->main_queue->get) {
        if ($event->isa('raumstatusd::Unifi::Event')) {
            say "macs: @{ $event->macs }"
        }
    }

}

sub _load_config {
    my ($file) = @_;

    open my $fh, '<', $file
        or die "Could not open config file: $file\n";

    # allow comments and trailing commata in lists
    my $json = JSON::XS->new->relaxed(1);

    my $config = $json->decode(do { local $/; <$fh> });

    for my $module (qw/unifi status db/) {
        die "config for $module does not exist."
            unless exists $config->{$module};

        die "config for $module is incomplete"
            unless 3 == grep { $config->{$module}{$_} }
                            qw/uri user pass/;
    }

    return $config;
}
